# 💫 About Me:
Hello! I'm Israel Alcántara, a dedicated Fourth Year Computer Science major at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, passionate about creating impactful software solutions and learning new technologies. My passion lies in solving challenging coding problems and building projects that push my skills forward.

Whether it's developing applications, collaborating on team projects, or organizing events as a leader, I’m always striving to grow and contribute. When I'm not coding, you can find me volunteering with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) or exploring new ways to improve efficiency and engagement in the workplace.

I'm always eager to learn and excited to continue my journey in full-stack development, artificial intelligence, and beyond. Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out!

## 🎉 Fun Facts:
- I'm fueled by caffeine ☕—perfect for those late-night debugging sessions.
- My work with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) has taught me as much about leadership as it has about tech.
- I enjoy breaking down complex problems, whether it's in code or real life — problem-solving is my go-to skill.
- Outside of coding, I'm always looking to streamline workflows and find new ways to improve productivity.
- When I’m not on my laptop, you might catch me exploring new tech or organizing projects for my team. I also love playing basketball 🏀, drawing ✍, taking photos 📷, listening to music 🎵, playing the piano 🎹, and read 📕 during my free time.
